# Dispatch and poll

`scripts/relay.mjs` is the dispatch layer. It wraps `agy --print`, runs the brief in Antigravity,
captures the final response, and writes a structured `result.json`. Your job collapses to: run one
command, then read one file.

## Before the first run: check the binary

```bash
command -v agy
agy help
agy models
```

`agy models` proves the CLI can authenticate and list available model labels. The relay records the
version it can infer from `agy changelog` into `result.json`. Neither command proves that a headless
write will be approved.

## Dispatching

```bash
node "<skill-dir>/scripts/relay.mjs" --brief brief.txt --cd /path/to/repo
```

(`<skill-dir>` is wherever this skill is installed - the folder containing its `SKILL.md`.)

Options:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--brief <file>` | The brief. Omit it to read the brief from stdin before passing it to `agy --print`. |
| `--cd <dir>` | Working root for Antigravity (default: current directory). |
| `--lane <name>` | Fleet lane from `delegate-setup` config. Applies that lane's dials; fails if the lane's `implementer` is not this relay. Explicit dial flags win. |
| `--model <name>` | Antigravity model label. Optional; a fresh run can use Antigravity's configured default. |
| `--effort <level>` | Reasoning effort: `low`, `medium`, or `high` (passed as agy's own `--effort`). |
| `--project <id>` | Use an existing Antigravity project. |
| `--new-project` | Force a fresh Antigravity project. This is the default for fresh dispatches. |
| `--resume-last` | Continue the most recent Antigravity conversation; send only the delta brief. |
| `--conversation <id>` | Continue a specific Antigravity conversation; send only the delta brief. |
| `--sandbox` | Enable Antigravity's terminal sandbox for the run. |
| `--read-only` | Run under agy's sandbox with tool approval auto-granted inside it (`--sandbox --dangerously-skip-permissions`); reads and writes are both confined to the workspace — a write appears to succeed to the agent but is overlaid and discarded. Mutually exclusive with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` as a flag (that flag alone, without the sandbox, is full access). |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Pass Antigravity's permission-bypass flag; mutually exclusive with `--read-only`. Never use this unless the human explicitly accepts it. |
| `--print-timeout <duration>` | Timeout agy itself applies to print mode (default: `30m`). |
| `--timeout <dur>` | Relay-side watchdog (e.g. `30m`); overrides the default of `--print-timeout` plus a 60s grace. On expiry the agy process tree is killed and `result.json` gets `status: "timeout"`. Set it explicitly when agy may hang past its own print timeout. Malformed, zero, and out-of-range durations are rejected; the maximum is `596h31m23s`. |
| `--add-dir <dir>` | Add an extra workspace directory. Repeatable; relative paths resolve against `--cd`. Fresh runs always add the `--cd` repo (absolute path) as a workspace dir. Edits inside extra workspaces are not reported in `touchedFiles`. |
| `--out-dir <dir>` | Where artifacts go (default: a fresh dir under the system temp dir). |

Artifacts default to the system temp dir on purpose: the repo under review stays clean, so the
touched-files report shows only Antigravity's edits and nothing of the helper's own.

## The result

`<out-dir>/result.json` is the contract. Fields:

- `schema` - the result-format version (currently `delegate-relay.result.v1`)
- `tool` - `agy`
- `status` - `completed` | `failed` | `timeout` | `aborted` | `agy_unavailable`
- `exitCode` - mirrors Antigravity's exit code; `128` plus the signal number if the child was killed; `127` if `agy` is not on PATH; on a `timeout` the relay forces a non-zero code even when the child exited `0` after the watchdog's SIGTERM
- `signal` - the signal that killed the child, otherwise `null`
- `agyVersion` - inferred from `agy changelog` when available
- `projectId` / `conversationId` - parsed from the Antigravity log when present
- `finalMessage` - Antigravity's stdout response
- `touchedFiles` - `git status --porcelain` lines in the working root: your review starting point.
  `null` (not `[]`) when git cannot report; `[]` means git ran and the tree is clean
- `readOnlyViolation` - `true` when fingerprints prove a working-tree change, `false` when coverage is complete and proves none, and `null` when fingerprinting was incomplete or the run was not `--read-only`
- `briefPath` / `finalPath` / `logPath` / `stderrPath` - the exact brief, final message, Antigravity
  log, and stderr capture
- `workdir`, `model`, `effort`, `project` (the `--project` you passed, vs `projectId` parsed from the log),
  `sandbox`, `readOnly`, `dangerouslySkipPermissions`, `resumed` (true for a `--resume-last` or `--conversation`
  run), `startedAt`, `finishedAt`
- `stderrTail` - last ~20 stderr lines; present on every run that did not complete (`failed`, `timeout`, `aborted`), except a launch failure, which reports `failed` with no `stderrTail`; also present when `finalMessage` is empty so diagnostics are not discarded
- `error` - present on a launch failure, `timeout`, `aborted`, headless permission denial, or silent no-op

The helper also prints a summary to stdout and normally exits with Antigravity's exit code. It forces
exit 1 when Antigravity exits 0 after a detected headless permission denial or with neither a final
message nor observable working-tree changes, so a wrapping script can branch on success/failure directly.

## Waiting for completion

The helper blocks until Antigravity finishes. Back it with whatever your orchestrator offers:

- **Claude Code:** run the Bash call with `run_in_background: true`; you're notified on completion,
  then read `result.json`.
- **Plain shell / other agents:** foreground for short tasks, or background and poll. A run is done
  when `result.json` exists with a `status`. A pre-run usage error exits with code 2 before writing any
  file, so check the exit code too. A missing `agy` binary exits 127 and writes `result.json` with
  `status: agy_unavailable`.

Trust the working tree and the process state over any progress display. A run is finished when the
process has exited and `result.json` is written.

## When a run misbehaves

- **`status: agy_unavailable` (exit 127):** `agy` is not on PATH. Install the Antigravity CLI and run
  its first-launch setup, then re-dispatch.
- **`status: timeout`:** the relay watchdog killed the run. Inspect `error` to see whether the selected
  limit was explicit `--timeout` or the derived `--print-timeout` plus 60s grace. The working tree may
  hold a half-applied change — inspect it before changing that limit, reducing the brief, or resuming.
- **`status: aborted`:** the relay itself was killed (its parent's timeout, a stopped task, a
  closed terminal) and forwarded the kill to agy. The result is written before the relay exits;
  inspect the working tree before re-dispatching. On native Windows a hard kill of the relay is
  uncatchable (Node supports no `SIGTERM` handler there), so this status may never get written -
  a relay process that is gone without a `result.json` is an aborted run; inspect the working
  tree and `events.jsonl` directly.
- **`status: failed` with `signal: "SIGKILL"`:** the host ended the child - commonly the OOM killer
  or a supervisor timeout, not an implementer error. Free up host memory or split the task into
  smaller briefs, then re-dispatch.
- **`status: failed`:** read `result.json`'s `stderrTail`, `stderrPath`, and `logPath` for the cause.
  Common causes: auth lapse, an unknown model label, timeout, or a permission the run needed.
- **Headless write permission denied:** the relay detects Antigravity's `no output produced ...
  auto-denied` stderr sentinel, reports `status: failed`, preserves `stderrTail`, and exits 1.
  Allow-rule matching and location vary by `agy` version and platform — a bare `command(<name>)` rule
  was insufficient on Windows/agy 1.2.5 but did work on macOS/agy 1.2.0 — so measure before assuming;
  see [Permission engine traps](#permission-engine-traps) below before re-dispatching or asking to use
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- **Empty `finalMessage`:** a run with edits may still be correct - check `touchedFiles`, the diff, and
  the preserved `stderrTail`. With no observable edits, the relay reports `status: failed` rather than
  claiming completion. To get a report next time, add a `<structured_output_contract>` block (see
  [writing-the-brief.md](writing-the-brief.md)).

## What the helper is doing

Under the hood the helper runs roughly:

```bash
agy --new-project --add-dir <repo> --print-timeout 30m --print=<brief>
agy --continue --print-timeout 30m --print=<delta brief>
agy --conversation <id> --print-timeout 30m --print=<delta brief>
```

`agy --print` requires the prompt as a flag argument, so keep briefs focused. The relay still accepts
stdin or `--brief <file>` for your convenience; it reads the text first, then passes it to `agy` as
`--print=<brief>` (the `=` form so a brief that begins with a bare flag like `--help` still runs).
Two consequences of the brief riding the command line: it is visible in the host process list (`ps`),
so on a shared machine keep secrets out of it; and a brief over ~120 KB is rejected up front (the OS
caps a single argument), so have `agy` read large context from the workspace instead of inlining it.

## The commit boundary

The helper never commits - by design, not omission. The robust contract is: Antigravity edits the
working tree, the orchestrator reviews and commits. See [review-and-land.md](review-and-land.md).

## Permission engine traps

When a headless `--print` run needs a permission `agy` cannot prompt for, it is auto-denied. `agy`'s own
error message advises adding an allow-rule under `permissions.allow` in
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`, e.g. `command(<target>)`. That instruction is incomplete
in measured ways, and what breaks varies by version and platform: following it literally still failed
on a plain, spaceless command like `git status` on the machine that documented these traps (Windows,
agy 1.2.5), while the same bare rule worked on macOS with agy 1.2.0.

### Exact-match rules don't cover real commands (measured on Windows, agy 1.2.5)

`command(<name>)` matches an exact command line, not a prefix. `command(git)` allows only a bare `git`
invocation with zero arguments - not `git status`, not anything a real task actually runs. This is the
first thing to check on *any* denial, before suspecting the Windows bug below: use
`command(regex:git .+)` (or a narrower pattern for a specific subcommand) to match real invocations.
Source: [issue #614 comment](https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-cli/issues/614#issuecomment-5466617752).

Measured on macOS with agy 1.2.0, the opposite held: `command(git)` alone in
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` allowed a real `git status` through a headless relay
dispatch (the identical brief with no rule was auto-denied). Treat exact-match behavior as version-
and platform-dependent, and test your own denial before assuming either way.

### Executable path splitting (Windows)

The permission engine splits a resolved executable path on whitespace before matching, so a binary
living under a path containing a space is evaluated as its first fragment. `node`, `git` and `npm`
installed under `C:\Program Files\...` are all evaluated as `C:\Program`, and no `command(<name>)` rule
- regex or not - matches any of them this way. This makes `git` the single most common trigger in
practice: it ships under `C:\Program Files\Git\...` by default on Windows, and nearly every delegated
coding brief runs `git status` at least once to check its own work. Measured directly on Windows 10 with
agy 1.1.12: with `command(node)` present in the allow list, a brief whose verification loop ran
`node --check` was auto-denied anyway.

### Which config file agy actually reads

`agy`'s denial message points at `permissions.allow` in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`.
Verified live on agy 1.2.5 on Windows: that file's `permissions` key was not what took effect - the
CLI's own log reported it as `permissions=<nil>` for that file, while a separate rule added under
`userSettings.globalPermissionGrants.allow` in **`~/.gemini/config/config.json`** was the one that
unblocked a denied `git status` call once written as `command(regex:git .+)`. A rule added to
`antigravity-cli/settings.json` in the exact form `agy`'s own message and error text describe did not
unblock the same call. This may be version- or platform-dependent; re-verify which file actually
applies before relying on this if you're on a different `agy` version, but don't assume the file
`agy` names in its own error is the one to edit.

Measured on macOS with agy 1.2.0, both files' rules took effect in live relay runs:
`command(regex:git .+)` unblocked a denied `git status` from either `antigravity-cli/settings.json`'s
`permissions.allow` or `config.json`'s `userSettings.globalPermissionGrants.allow`. The divergence
between installs is real, so the only reliable rule is the one above: verify which file your install
actually reads before trusting `agy`'s own error text.

### Write file glob error

Upstream issue #614 also reports that a glob in a `write_file` rule - `write_file(C:\path\*)` - raises "globs not supported"
and blocks the agent's actions entirely. Directory rules are recursive already, so the glob is unnecessary as well as harmful.

### Workarounds and caveats

- **Command permissions:** combine the two fixes above - `command(regex:<name> .+)` in
  `~/.gemini/config/config.json`'s `globalPermissionGrants.allow` (verified on agy 1.2.5; on macOS
  with agy 1.2.0 the same regex in `antigravity-cli/settings.json` also unblocked the call) covers both
  the exact-match trap and, since it doesn't depend on matching a resolved executable path, the
  Windows path-splitting bug too. `command(*)` (documented in issue #614) is the broader fallback if a
  targeted regex still doesn't match - it approves all command execution, so treat it the same as
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for that run.
- **Directory permissions:** Write directory paths literally without a wildcard, e.g. `write_file(C:\path)`.

If settings allow-rules cannot resolve the denial, ask the human before re-dispatching with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`;
that flag auto-approves every tool permission request and the run must be treated as full access.
